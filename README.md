üñºÔ∏è A user-friendly mobile app for creative people to store, manage, and edit their artistic references!

## üöÄ Usage
To download the *ref*rigerator app for Android, go to the releases section and download the latest release.

## ‚ú® Inspiration
I started making this app when I had a picture of my favorite musician that I really wanted to try to draw. I'm not a great artist, and I had to use the grid technique to draw the picture, so I started looking for an app that could help me do that. A lot of them had paid plans, or required an account creation, or I just didn't like their UI. So I decided to try to make this app, since around the same time I was also looking into learning Flutter.

## üñåÔ∏è Features

- Upload images from your device or take a picture
- Name files, sort by name or date modified
- Add grid lines to help you draw
- Add image filter to alter colors
- Crop picture accordingto aspect ratio or free selection
- Export the edited image to your device
- Dark & light mode, with system color theme

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
I made this app using Flutter and Material Design.

I had never really used Flutter or Dart before this project, so I learned so much while working on this project. Finding the right cropping package was a struggle, as well as figuring out how to layer all of the different image effects in the editor and learning to interact with the device's file system.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Development
To test this project on your own device, run:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
